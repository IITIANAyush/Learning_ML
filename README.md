# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Playground

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Projects** repository!  
This is where I explore and implement a variety of ML and Deep Learning ideas as part of my **self-learning journey**. The aim is to build practical skills by solving real-world problems and experimenting with different tools, libraries, and models.

## ðŸš€ Goals

- Understand core ML algorithms and their implementations
- Work on real datasets from Kaggle, UCI, etc.
- Build and fine-tune deep learning models (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers)
- Learn MLOps tools and model deployment
- Document learnings and best practices
